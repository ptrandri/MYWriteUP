The error message you encountered indicates that the installation of the `deasync` package failed during the `npm install` process. This error is often caused by missing dependencies or a problem with the package itself.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Delete the `node_modules` directory in your project. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   ```

2. Clear the npm cache by running the following command:

   ```
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. Update npm to the latest version by running:

   ```
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

4. Install the `deasync` package separately by running:

   ```
   npm install deasync@0.1.28
   ```

   This command will install the specific version of `deasync` mentioned in the error message.

5. After installing `deasync`, try running `npm install` again:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

If the issue persists, it's possible that there is a compatibility problem between the `deasync` package and your Node.js version. You may consider checking if there is an updated version of the package available or exploring alternative packages that serve a similar purpose.

Additionally, reviewing the detailed log file mentioned in the error message can provide more information about the specific error encountered. You can examine the contents of the log file located at `/root/.npm/_logs/2023-05-19T08_44_19_708Z-debug.log` to gain further insights into the issue.
